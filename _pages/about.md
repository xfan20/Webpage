I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Sociology](http://www.shehui.lb.pku.edu.cn/wap/) at Peking University, with a regional affiliation at the [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.

I am interested in demography, social networks, and computational social science. My research goal is to advance the understanding of the role of human communications and interactions in shaping social, population, and belief systems to better design social policies and tools improving social welfare.
